Good job, Lisa! You're very close to having hard mode complete.
The data is being stored in Mongo but isn't being displayed after page refresh.
For data binding to work, you want to set the data as a property of the object you're binding to.
Replacing the entire object, instead of a property, will stop the view from being able to bind to the object.

In addition to that, there is one other minor change that needs to be made.
Mongo is creating a collection named movies rather than movie.
Make sure to always reference the plural version of the collection when creating the model connected to your schema.
Overall, your code is looking good. You have good comments on the client side, a readme and a good number of commits.
This will be helpful when diving into your solo and group projects.
The client.js file could be cleaned up a bit, both in code formatting and consistency.






I'd recommend declaring your functions in the factory and keeping your return object concise.
Nice work utilizing grunt. It looks like you're tracking well on this.
It was a big assignment with a lot of components.
Great work getting through base mode and most of hard mode.
If you have time, I'd recommend going back and finishing that up.
