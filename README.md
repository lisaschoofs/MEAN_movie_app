# Prime Weekend Challenge 5 - Angular & APIs

For this challenge, we worked with Angular and the OMDB API to build an application that can search movies and allow users to store their favorites. During this week in the program, we had just started learning AngularJS. 

At the time of this project's creation, the OMDB API was free for use. Since that time, OMDB stopped offering free access to its API. If you try to download this project and run it locally, it unfortunately will not work.

## Technologies Used:

- AngularJS
- MongoDB
- Node.js
- Express
- Bootstrap
- HTML 5
- CSS 3
